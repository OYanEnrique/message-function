# ✍️ Dynamic Message Writer

A simple, non-interactive script that showcases a reusable Python function. The function, `write()`, takes any string as an argument and prints it to the console with a decorative border that automatically adjusts to the message's length.

## Features

* **Reusable Function**: The core logic is encapsulated in a `write()` function, making it easy to reuse.
* **Dynamic Border**: The top and bottom borders are automatically sized to match the length of the input message.
* **Clean Output**: Creates a visually distinct, framed message in the terminal.

## How to Use

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `message_function.py`).
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python message_function.py
    ```
4.  The script will automatically run and print the hardcoded message "Hello World!" with its border. You can easily change the message inside the script to whatever you like.

### Script Output

```
------------
Hello World!
------------
```
